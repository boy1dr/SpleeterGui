## SpleeterGUI - Music source separation desktop app  
Windows Desktop Front end for Spleeter - AI source separation  
   

   
## So long and thanks for all the fish!  
  
I have enjoyed the popularty of this software and can only hope it that it continues to be an asset to those who would find it useful.  
  
Please contact me mitchell_cj@hotmail.com if you would like to take on this project and continue to provide it for general use.  
  
I will provide the latest version of the software on my github and keep all prevous github repositories online. But any and all downloadable packages will be removed.  
  
If there is a new location for an installable version of this software i will link it here.  
  
The compressed project is now 904MB and is downloaded 4,400 times per month (averaged per month over the past 12 months...no joke). so expect ~4TB/month.  
   
I have always provided a complied verion of this software for easy install but Microsoft continue to flag these as virus infected and i can no longer suport such an endeavour.  
  
Please understand this decision has not come lightly.  
    
It is also likely that in the next few weeks i will pull my content from youtube because of a very recent change to their TOS.  

---------------------------------  

Latest installer can be downloaded from here https://makenweb.com/#spleetergui  
No need to install python or spleeter, this app contains a portable version of python pre-loaded with spleeter.  

The aim for this project is to make it easy for Windows users to download and run Spleeter without needing to use the command line tools to do so.
